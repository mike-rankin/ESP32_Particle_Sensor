This project is an ESP32 internet of things desktop particle sensor. It was created as an excuse to try out a new air particle sensor that I came across. This project shows the level of particles in the air, date, time, wifi strength, temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure and gas value. Time is updated every minute minutes over wifi from an NTP server. 

Hardware on this board:
-ESP32 Wroom processor
-air sensor (Bosch BME680)
-particle sensor(PMSA003-A)
-240x240 TFT LCD (ER-TFT1.54-1)
-3.3V LDO (NCP1117LPST33T3G)
-USB interface (CP2104N)
-USB-C Connector
-QwiiC i2c Connector
